# **OSI** model : **O**pen **S**ystem **I**nterconnection 

The **OSI model** i divided into seven different layers, each of which fulfills a very specific function. 
When combined together, each function contributes to enables full host to host data communication. 

![[osi_model.png|150]]

Here, they will be presented from bottom to top ; it makes more sense in my reasoning.  But usual convention go from layer 7 - layer 8 behind the end-user - to layer 1 since it's the natural path of data. 

# The seven layers
## [[1. Physical]]

Layer 1 is anything that carries bits between two nodes. In other words, what is responsible for actual signal transmission.
That goes from the cable, to the [[Modem]], repeater or [[Hub]]. 
Actually, "cable" is a limited term since its include wireless communication which use radio waves, while Ethernet cable transfer in the form of electric pulse and fiber in the form of pulses of light. 

## [[2. Data link]]

Layer 2 is responsible for interfacing with the Physical layer : it put bits to the "wire" and pull it out of it. 
It groups together bits into chunks known as 'frame'.
Layer 2 have its addressing system known as the [[MAC]] (Media Access Control) address. It **uniquely identifies** each individual [[NIC]] (Network Interface Controller)or others layer 2 devices such as the [[Switch]].
MAC address is pre-configured by manufacturer and sometimes referred to as Burned In Address (BIA).

The overarching function of the Data Link layer is to deliver packets from one NIC to another. Or put it another way, **the role of layer 2 is to deliver packets from hop to hop.**

## [[3. Network]]

**Network layer is responsible for packet delivery from end to end.**
It does that by logically identify every node connected to the Internet., using an another addressing scheme. Its known as the [[IP]] (Internet Protocol) address.
It is considered logical because an IP address is not a permanent identification of an host. Unlike MAC address, IP address is not burned into any host hardware by the manufacturer. 
[[Router]] are network devices that operate at layer 3 of the OSI model. A router's primary responsibility is to facilitate communication between networks. As such, a router creates a boundary between two networks. In order to communicate with any device not directly in your network, a router must be used.

### Layer 2 vs. Layer 3

When a computer has data to send, it encapsulates (to be detailed soon) it in a IP header which will include information like the source and destination IP addresses of the two "ends" of the communication.
The IP header and data are further encapsulated in a MAC address header, which will include information like the source and destination MAC address of the current "hop" in the path towards the final destination. 

Here is an illustration to drive this point home : 
![[layer2VSlayer3.gif|400]]

Between each router, the MAC address header is stripped and regenerated to get it to the next hop. The IP header generated by the first computer is only stripped off by the final computer, hence the **IP header handled the "end to end" delivery**, and each of the four different **MAC headers involved in this example handled the "hop to hop" delivery**. 

## [[4. Transport]]

The transport layer of the OSI model is responsible for distinguishing network streams. 
An host can run several different application running. Each of these application are sending and receiving data from the Internet, and all that data is arriving in the form of bits on that host.
The layer 4 is there to distinguish which bits belong to which applications.

![[osi_model_layer4.png|200]]
**The transport layer accomplished this by using an addressing scheme known as Port Numbers.**

Specifically, two methods of distinguishing network streams exist. They are known as the [[TCP]] (Transmission Control Protocol), or the [[UDP]] (User Datagram Protocol).
TCP and UDP have each 65,536 port numbers, and a unique application stream is identified by both source and destination port (in combination with their source and destination IP address).

**Layer 4 is responsible for service to service delivery.**

Standardized model made to represent the theory behind networking. Its consists of 7 layers : 

[[Jeremy Bower notes/Network/7. Application|7. Application]] : 
     Provides networking options to programs. It provide them an interface to transmit data. When data is given to the application layer, it is passed down to presentation layer. 

[[Jeremy Bower notes/Network/6. Presentation|6. Presentation]] : 
     Receive data from application layer. This data tends to be in a format that the (sender) application understands, but not necessarily in a standardized format that could be understood y the application layer in the *receiving* computer. The presentation layer **translates** the data into standardized format, as well as handling **encryption**, **compression** or other transformations to the data. Then, data is passed down to the session layer. 

[[Jeremy Bower notes/Network/5. Session|5. Session]] :
     Now, this correctly formatted data need to be transmitted to the other computer across the network. For that, the hosts need to establish a connection, or *session*. If not possible, it sends back an error and the process goes no further.  If the session possible, the session layer job is to maintain it and co-operate with the session layer of the remote computer in order to synchronize communications. 
     That layer is important as the session it creates is unique to the communication in question. Which allow multiple requests to different endpoints simultaneously without all data getting mixed up. When session layer has successfully logged a connection between the host and remote computer, the data is passed down to layer 4 : the transport Layer. 

[[Jeremy Bower notes/Network/4. Transport|4. Transport]] : 
     The first purpose of this layer is to choose the protocol over which the data is to be transmitted. The two common protocols are [[4. Transport#^2d75e6|TCP]] and [[bootcamp_notes/Network/4. Transport#^bf6704|UDP]]. With a protocol selecte, the transport layer then divides the transmission up into bite-sized pieces (over TCP these are called *segments*, over UDP they're called *datagrams*) which makes it easier to transmit the message successfully. 

[[Jeremy Bower notes/Network/3. Network|3. Network]] :
	That the layer responsible for locating the destination of your request. For example,when you want to request information from a web page, it's the network layer that takes the IP address for the page and figures out the route to take.   
	At this stage, we're working with what is referred as *logical addressing* which are still software controlled. Logical addresses are used to provide order to networks, categorizing them and allowing us to properly sort them. The most common form of logical addressing is the IPv4 format. 

[[Jeremy Bower notes/Network/2. Data Link|2. Data Link]] :
     The data link layer focuses on the *physical addressing* of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (which includes the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical (MAC) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network enabled computer is a **N**etwork **I**nterface **C**ard (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC (**M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol) address to identify it.  
     MAC addresses are set byt the manufacture and literally burnt into the cart ; they can't be changed - although they can be spoofed. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify were exactly to send the information.   
     Additionally, it's also the job of the data link layer to present the data in format suitable for transmission.   
     The data link layer also serves in important function when it receives data, as it checks the received information to make sure that it hasn't been corrupted during transmission, which could well happen when the data is transmitted by layer 1 : the physical layer. 

[[Jeremy Bower notes/Network/1. Physical|1. Physical]] :
     The physical layer is right down to the hardware of the computer. This is here the electrical pulses that make up data transfer over a network are sent and received. It's the job of the physical layer to convert the binary data of the transmission into signals an transmit them across the network, as well as receiving incoming signals and converting them back into binary data.
