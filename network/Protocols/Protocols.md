*Protocols are made to establish a common languages and set of rules for communication between devices and systems.
They are different protocols for different types of processes.*

**[ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)](ARP%20(Address%20Resolution%20Protocol).md) :** ARP translates IP addresses into [MAC](MAC) addresses.

**[BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)](BGP%20(Border%20Gateway%20Protocol))** : application layer protocol that networks use to broadcast which IP addresses they control. This information allows routers to decide which networks data packets should pass through on the way to their destinations.

**[IP (Internet Protocol)](IP%20(Internet%20Protocol).md)** : provides the rules for identifying devices and routing data packets between them, making global communication over the internet possible. 

**[TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)](TCP%20(Transmission%20Control%20Protocol))** : 

**[UDP (User Datagram Protocol)](UDP%20(User%20Datagram%20Protocol))** :
